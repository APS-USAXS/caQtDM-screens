2017-08-04 Qt Designer notes

Use Layouts to resolve font size problems
  * form layouts for label:entry pairs
  * grid layouts for all other arrays
  * adjust spacing to separate items

Setup a window
  * start designer with caQtDM libraries
  * create a MainWindow (QMainWindow, by name)
  * verify caQtDM widgets available

Edit a lot of widgets with the same modification 
  * (such as font size or a stylesheet customization)

shutter screens look good
  * need to check the actions on the two buttons
  * should make a common shutter screen and re-use

9idc_usaxs.ui
  * needs graphic for the mirrors
  * apply QGroupBox
  * apply grid/form layouts
  * convert stack of labels (if A=1...) to single "mode: ..." display
